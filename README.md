# go-articles-test

Simple Articles Backend in Go

## What's this project?

This is a simple demonstration of how I write Go code, as I have been requested to do so on multiple occasions.
You can create articles and fetch them, add comments to articles, and fetch comments on articles.
I did it in about 5 hours of work over a few days
Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss this repo.

## How to run?

Use the `make run-local` command for an easy local run, and ensure the correct database host and credentials as in the `local_db_env_vars_init.sh`.

Or you can use `make run` but make sure to expose the same env vars as in `local_db_env_vars_init.sh`

## API

All the endpoints are available under a versioned system. The current version is `v1`
